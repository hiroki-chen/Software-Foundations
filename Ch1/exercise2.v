(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (even_S) *)
(** One inconvenient aspect of our definition of even n is the recursive call on n - 2. This makes 
proofs about even n harder when done by induction on n, since we may need an induction hypothesis about

induction: *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (add_shuffle3') *)
(**  The replace tactic allows you to specify a particular subterm to rewrite and what you want it
rewritten to: replace (t) with (u) replaces (all copies of) expression t in the goal by expression u,
and generates t = u as an additional subgoal. This is often useful when a plain rewrite acts on the
wrong part of the goal.
Use the replace tactic to do a proof of add_shuffle3', just like add_shuffle3 but without needing assert. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, especially useful (binary_commute) *)
(* Prove that the following diagram commutes:
                            incr
              bin ----------------------> bin
               |                           |
    bin_to_nat |                           |  bin_to_nat

              nat ----------------------> nat
                             S
That is, incrementing a binary number and then converting it to a (unary) natural number yields the same result as first converting it to a natural number and then incrementing.
If you want to change your previous definitions of incr or bin_to_nat to make the property easier to
prove, feel free to do so! *)
